    <h3>Space Project Evaluation</h3>
    <h4>Family Member Eval</h4>
<p>They liked the overall layout of the website. They really liked the color scheme and pictures. 
I did not know that the family member was going to read the entire website word for word, but they
did. They gave me the following suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Home Page- Try to have the first picture and wording around the same size.</li>
<li>Home Page- The section with the three columns would look better if they were
all even and the pictures were all the same size</li>
<li>FAQs Page- One of the first questions should state "the" instead of "a" because
all the rest of the questions referenced "the" Dragon instead of "a" Dragon</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that they really liked was the 3D Carousel that I did on the history page. They stated that it
was nice. They also stated that it might pose a little bit of a challenge for someone if they are not
tech savvy enough to know to keep the cursor on the picture to hold it in place to read the 
information, but other than that, they were really impressed with me designing my first website.</p>
<h4>My Thoughts About The Project</h4>
<p>I took the suggestions that were given to me by the family member, corrected those, and polished up my FAQs page a little bit better. Truthfully, I was not going to start over due to time constraints and deadlines, so I just made the changes I needed to make. As I become more proficient, it might become an option, but not at this time.</p>
<p>Even though this was extremely difficult, I made it a point to show up every day, ask questions, and take notes until I was able to apply what I learned proficiently. I watched so many videos and googled so many ways how I should do this or that and practiced repeatedly until I felt more comfortable in applying what I learned.</p>
<p>Overall, I am quite happy with my first project. I had to really prepare myself mentally for the outcome of the project because this is all very new to me and not to be so hard on myself when it does not look like someone elseâ€™s project. I had many days where I would listen to the instructor and take notes only to be totally lost and confused because of his speed of lecture and application. My brain simply did not work that fast. No matter what, I was going to do my best!</p>

<h3>Progressive Enhancement Writing</h3>
<p>I found an article about progressive enhancement that was interesting. From what I read about progressive enhancement; it is being able to provide the user a good experience according to browser preferability. When someone wants a website, I am sure they do not think about all the extra things that need to be considered when designing a website. Anyone who visits the website should be able to access the content desired without problems. The main goal is to access the content in order to take an action, make an informed decision, or just find out information.</p>
<p>Progressive enhancement is creating an experience. It starts with the content markup in HTML, dress up the content with CSS, and interaction functionality with JavaScript. Be careful not to overdo it or go for the gusto with all the enhancements because you could do more harm than good. When someone visits a website they visit for a reason and by creating too many distractions could cause the user to leave the site and search for another site for what they were searching for.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons to focus on progressive enhancement before building your website include a strong foundation, stability, and SEO and accessibility. The article mentioned Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) being built with progressive enhancement as a core principle and they provide good user experiences and are easily accessible.
