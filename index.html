    <h3>Space Project Evaluation</h3>
    <h4>Family Member Eval</h4>
<p>They liked the overall layout of the website. They really liked the color scheme and pictures. 
I did not know that the family member was going to read the entire website word for word, but they
did. They gave me the following suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Home Page- Try to have the first picture and wording around the same size.</li>
<li>Home Page- The section with the three columns would look better if they were
all even and the pictures were all the same size</li>
<li>FAQs Page- One of the first questions should state "the" instead of "a" because
all the rest of the questions referenced "the" Dragon instead of "a" Dragon</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that they really liked was the 3D Carousel that I did on the history page. They stated that it
was nice. They also stated that it might pose a little bit of a challenge for someone if they are not
tech savvy enough to know to keep the cursor on the picture to hold it in place to read the 
information, but other than that, they were really impressed with me designing my first website.</p>
